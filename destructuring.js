Use Destructuring Assignment to Extract Values from Objects
Destructuring assignment is special syntax introduced in ES6, for neatly assigning values taken directly from an object.

Consider the following ES5 code:

const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 34 };

const name = user.name;
const age = user.age;
name would have a value of the string John Doe, and age would have the number 34.

Here's an equivalent assignment statement using the ES6 destructuring syntax:

const { name, age } = user;
Again, name would have a value of the string John Doe, and age would have the number 34.

Here, the name and age variables will be created and assigned the values of their respective values from the user object. You can see how much cleaner this is.

You can extract as many or few values from the object as you want.

Replace the two assignments with an equivalent destructuring assignment.
It should still assign the variables today and tomorrow the values of today and tomorrow from the HIGH_TEMPERATURES object.

const HIGH_TEMPERATURES = {
    yesterday: 75,
    today: 77,
    tomorrow: 80
  };
  
  // Only change code below this line
  
  const today = HIGH_TEMPERATURES.today;
  const tomorrow = HIGH_TEMPERATURES.tomorrow;
  
  // Only change code above this line

const HIGH_TEMPERATURES = {
    yesterday: 75,
    today: 77,
    tomorrow: 80
  };
  
  // Only change code below this line
  
  const {today, tomorrow} = HIGH_TEMPERATURES;
  
  // Only change code above this line

  Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Objects
Destructuring allows you to assign a new variable name when extracting values. You can do this by putting the new name after a colon when assigning the value.

Using the same object from the last example:

const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 34 };
Here's how you can give new variable names in the assignment:

const { name: userName, age: userAge } = user;
You may read it as "get the value of user.name and assign it to a new variable named userName" and so on. The value of userName would be the string John Doe, and the value of userAge would be the number 34.

Replace the two assignments with an equivalent destructuring assignment. It should still assign the variables highToday and highTomorrow the values of today and tomorrow from the HIGH_TEMPERATURES object.

const HIGH_TEMPERATURES = {
    yesterday: 75,
    today: 77,
    tomorrow: 80
  };
  
  // Only change code below this line
  
const highToday = HIGH_TEMPERATURES.today;
const highTomorrow = HIGH_TEMPERATURES.tomorrow; 

// Only change code above this line

  // Only change code below this line
    
  const {today: highToday, tomorrow: highTomorrow } = HIGH_TEMPERATURES;
  
  // Only change code above this line

  Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Nested Objects
You can use the same principles from the previous two lessons to destructure values from nested objects.

Using an object similar to previous examples:

const user = {
  johnDoe: { 
    age: 34,
    email: 'johnDoe@freeCodeCamp.com'
  }
};
Here's how to extract the values of object properties and assign them to variables with the same name:

const { johnDoe: { age, email }} = user;
And here's how you can assign an object properties' values to variables with different names:

const { johnDoe: { age: userAge, email: userEmail }} = user;
Replace the two assignments with an equivalent destructuring assignment. It should still assign the variables lowToday and highToday the values of today.low and today.high from the LOCAL_FORECAST object.

const LOCAL_FORECAST = {
    yesterday: { low: 61, high: 75 },
    today: { low: 64, high: 77 },
    tomorrow: { low: 68, high: 80 }
  };
  
  // Only change code below this line
    
  const lowToday = LOCAL_FORECAST.today.low;
  const highToday = LOCAL_FORECAST.today.high;
  
  // Only change code above this line

  // Only change code below this line
  
const {today: {low: lowToday, high: highToday}} = LOCAL_FORECAST;

// Only change code above this line

Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Arrays
ES6 makes destructuring arrays as easy as destructuring objects.

One key difference between the spread operator and array destructuring is that the spread operator unpacks all contents of an array into a comma-separated list. Consequently, you cannot pick or choose which elements you want to assign to variables.

Destructuring an array lets us do exactly that:

const [a, b] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
console.log(a, b);
The console will display the values of a and b as 1, 2.

The variable a is assigned the first value of the array, and b is assigned the second value of the array. We can also access the value at any index in an array with destructuring by using commas to reach the desired index:

const [a, b,,, c] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
console.log(a, b, c);
The console will display the values of a, b, and c as 1, 2, 5.

Use destructuring assignment to swap the values of a and b so that a receives the value stored in b, and b receives the value stored in a.

let a = 8, b = 6;
// Only change code below this line
[a,b] = [b,a];
